      <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
      <p>CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.</p>
      <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for <span class="bold underline">C</span>ascading <span class="bold underline">S</span>tyle <span class=" bold underline">S</span>heets</li>
          <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
          <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
          <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
        <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>
        <h3>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h3>
        <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

          HTML was created to describe the content of a web page like headings and paragraphs.
          
          When tags like font, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
          
          To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
          
          CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>
          <h3>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h3>
          <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.

            With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
          
          <h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
          <p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</p>

          <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

            The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
            
            Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
            
            Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>So if HTML is the foundation, frames, walls, and girders supporting your website, consider CSS the paint color, window styles, and landscaping that comes on afterward. You can’t get anywhere without putting that foundation up first, but—once you do—you’ll want to follow up with some style, and CSS is the ticket to unleashing your inner decorator.</p>
